# Phase 1: Performance Improvements Implementation

## Image Optimization

- Added responsive image support through Astro's image optimization
- Created reusable `OptimizedImage` and `OptimizedPicture` components
- Configured automatic image processing for both local and remote images
- Implemented proper image dimensions to avoid CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)

## Resource Loading Optimization

- Added preconnect and preload directives for critical resources
- Implemented a priority system for critical assets (fonts, hero image)
- Added lazy loading for non-critical images using Intersection Observer API
- Configured responsive image sizes and formats (WebP, AVIF)

## Performance Monitoring

- Added development-only performance monitoring tools
- Created utility to measure and report core web vitals
- Implemented bundle size optimization through Vite/Rollup configuration
- Added automatic CSS optimization with code splitting

## Testing

- Added tests for image optimization components
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing tests

This implementation improves initial load performance, reduces bandwidth usage, and ensures better Core Web Vitals metrics across all devices.
